# FlickrGallery
An iOS Application that uses Flickr API

To run this app, you need to have Xcode installed on your mac.

Due to the time constraint, I did not spend time on UI and Icons.

I used Singleton Pattern for Helper Classes.

For cache implementation, I used Observer Pattern.

Because of the time constraint, I did not write any Unit Tests and did not implement user friendly error messages.
